# 👋 Hi, I'm Conner Passafiume

I'm a data professional who loves using data to make smarter decisions. Whether it's helping a business understand its sales patterns or breaking down NFL strategy with advanced metrics, I'm obsessed with turning raw data into clear, actionable insights.

## 🧠 What Drives Me

I’m deeply passionate about **strategy**, **decision-making**, and **predictive thinking** — and I believe data is the most powerful tool we have to support all three.

My biggest inspiration comes from football, where split-second decisions are made based on preparation, trends, and probabilities. That same mindset applies to business analytics, and I’ve spent years sharpening my ability to:

- Model outcomes
- Spot patterns
- Identify inefficiencies
- Build tools that inform smarter choices
- And ultimately, find the edge.

My goal? To **master data intelligence**.

## 💼 What I Do

### 📊 Power BI & Excel Reporting
- Design **interactive dashboards** to support decision-makers
- Use **Power Query**, **DAX**, and **Excel automation** to streamline reporting
- Build tools that highlight opportunities and risks at a glance

### 🐍 Python for Data Modeling
- Clean, transform, and analyze complex datasets with `pandas` and `numpy`
- Create models that simulate scenarios and project outcomes
- Use data visualizations (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`) to tell compelling stories

### 🗃️ SQL for Analysis & Data Engineering
- Write advanced queries with **joins**, **window functions**, and **CTEs**
- Design and manage **relational databases** in MySQL and SQL Server
- Analyze trends, behaviors, and performance across time and categories

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 🧠 **Football Research Database**
A fully integrated analytics database built from scratch using play-by-play, roster, salary cap, and PFF data.

- **SQL + Python** backend with normalized schema and player/team ID matching
- Tracks QB efficiency, pass rush productivity, run-blocking grades, and more
- Enables questions like:
  - Which QBs consistently outperform expectation?
  - What traits correlate with elite pass-rushing seasons?
  - How should teams allocate salary cap dollars based on positional value?

This project shows my ability to **engineer data pipelines**, **model complex systems**, and **ask meaningful questions** — all transferable to business and product analytics.
